# warp_sandbox
Warp is a free software that is used for computational modeling of accelerator
systems. The software is freely available at warp.lbl.gov where the install
instructions, along with more details about the software, are available.

Although I think Warp is a great piece of software I find the documentation and
example scripts can be a bit nebulousâ€“especially when trying to perform more
creative coding using the software.

This repo spawned out of my tinkering with the Warp code during my research and
looking to provide better documentation for myself. Thus, the work here is
ongoing and some implementations may not be the best method.
Nonetheless I hope that my examples, even if they are pitiful at best, will be
useful.
